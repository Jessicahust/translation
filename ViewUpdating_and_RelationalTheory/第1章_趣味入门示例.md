	Example is always more efficacious than precept

	例子总是比规则更有效
	//身教重于言教
			—— 塞缪尔·约翰逊: 《拉塞勒斯》(1759)

Examples throughout this book are based for the most part on the familiar (not to say hackneyed) suppliers-and-parts database. I apologize for dragging out this old warhorse yet one more time, but as I’ve said elsewhere, I believe using the same example in a variety of different publications can be a help, not a hindrance, in learning. In SQL terms[1],the database contains three tables— more specifically, three base tables—called S (“suppliers”), P (“parts”), and SP (“shipments”), respectively. Sample values are shown in Fig. 1.1.

本书中的示例大多基于常见(而不老套)的汽车配件与供应商(suppliers-and-parts)数据库。 很惭愧我一直都在使用这个例子,但就如我曾多次提到, 在各个地方使用同样的例子可以快速掌握核心知识,而不因背景知识的不同而成为学习的阻碍。用SQL专业术语来说[1], 这个数据库(database)包含三张表(table) —— 更确切地说,是三张基本表,分别是: S(“供应商”,suppliers)、P(“配件”,parts), 以及SP(“供货单”,shipments)。示例数据如图1.1所示。

表 1.1 : 供应商(S, suppliers)与配件(P, parts)表结构及相关数据

<hr/>

1' I use SQL and SQL-style syntax in this introductory chapter for reasons of familiarity, despite the fact that it’s not really to my taste, and (more to the point, perhaps) despite the fact that it actually makes the motivating example harder to explain properly.

1' 在本章中使用了SQL以及SQL风格的语法,为了熟悉和方便,作者觉得不这样的话会对精彩的入门示例学习造成一些学习障碍.



The semantics (in outline) are as follows:

每张表所代表的含义如下:



Table S represents suppliers under contract. Each supplier has one supplier number (SNO), unique to that supplier; one name (SNAME), not necessarily unique (though the sample values shown in Fig. 1.1 do happen to be unique); one status value (STATUS); and one location (CITY). Note: In the rest of this book I’ll abbreviate “suppliers under contract,” most of the time, to just suppliers.

表 **S** 对应的是合同供应商. 每个供应商都有一个唯一编号(SNO, supplier number); 一个名字(SNAME),名字不要求是唯一的(碰巧图1.1中的示例数据中没有重复的名字);  一个状态值(STATUS); 以及一个地理位置(CITY). 请注意: 在本书中,一般将 合同供应商(suppliers under contract) 简写为 供应商(suppliers).

Table P represents kinds of parts. Each kind of part has one part number (PNO), which is unique; one name (PNAME); one color (COLOR); one weight (WEIGHT); and one location where parts of that kind are stored (CITY). Note: In the rest of this book I’ll abbreviate “kinds of parts,” most of the time, to just parts.

表 **P** 代表各种配件. 每种配件有一个唯一的 配件编号(PNO, part number); 一个名字(PNAME); 一种颜色(COLOR); 一个重量值(WEIGHT); 以及这种类型的配件存放的位置(CITY). 请注意: 在本书中,一般将 配件种类(kinds of parts) 简写为 配件(parts).


Table SP represents shipments—it shows which parts are shipped, or supplied, by which suppliers. Each shipment has one supplier number (SNO); one part number (PNO); and one quantity (QTY). Also, there’s at most one shipment at any given time for a given supplier and given part, and so the combination of supplier number and part number is unique to any given shipment. Note: In the rest of this book I’ll assume QTY values are
always greater than zero.

表 **SP** 表示的是运送关系. 即每种类型的配件,由 哪个供应商送货/供货. 每条运送关系包括一个供应商编号(SNO); 一个配件种类编号(PNO); 以及运送数量(QTY). 当然,同一种货物与同一个供应商只会有一条记录,所以供应商编号与配件种类编号两者组合起来就是唯一的. 请注意: 在本书中, 假设 QTY 的值都是正整数.

Now I want to focus on table S specifically; for the rest of this chapter, in fact, I’ll mostly ignore tables P and SP, except for an occasional remark here and there. Here’s an SQL definition for that table S:

下面,我们看看表 S 的定义; 本章主要着重讲 S 表, 而对 P 表和 SP 表则会一笔带过. 

	CREATE TABLE S
		(	SNO VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL ,
			SNAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL ,
			STATUS INTEGER NOT NULL ,
			CITY VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL ,
			UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;

As I’ve said, table S is a base table, but of course we can define any number of views “on top of” that base table. Here are a couple of examples—LS (“London suppliers”) and NLS (“non London suppliers”):

如前面所说, S 表是一张基础表, 但我们可以在这张基础表“之上”定义多个视图. 例如,我们可以定义两个视图, LS(“London suppliers”,伦敦供应商) 和 NLS (“non London suppliers”,非伦敦供应商):

	CREATE VIEW LS /* London suppliers */ AS
		(	SELECT SNO , SNAME , STATUS , CITY
			FROM S
			WHERE CITY = ‘London’ ) ;

	CREATE VIEW NLS /* non London suppliers */ AS
		(	SELECT SNO , SNAME , STATUS , CITY
			FROM S
			WHERE CITY <> ‘London’ ) ;

Sample values for these views corresponding to the value of table S in Fig. 1.1 are shown
in Fig. 1.2.

与图1.1中S表相对应的视图数据如图1.2所示:

![](F1.2_Views.png)

Fig. 1.2: Views LS and NLS—sample values

图1.2 视图 LS 与 NLS 的示例数据

Views LS and NLS are the ones I want to use in this initial chapter as the basis for my
motivating example. In essence, what I want to do with that example is try to give you some preliminary idea as to why I believe that—contrary to popular opinion and most conventional wisdom in this area—all views are updatable. (Note, however, that I must immediately qualify this very strong claim by making it clear that I’m necessarily speaking rather loosely at this stage. Later chapters will elaborate.)


视图 LS 与 NLS 是本章节的基础. 


使用这些例子的本意,是尽量让你初步意识到,为什么**我相信所有的视图都是可更新的**(而这与传统的思想和观念恰恰相反,但我必须在这里立即着重强调, 明确声明, 虽然不是很正式。后面的章节会详细介绍)。



### THE PRINCIPLE OF INTERCHANGEABILITY

### 可交换原则

So far, then, table S is a base table and tables LS and NLS are views. Observe now, however, that it could have been the other way around—that is, I could have made LS and NLS base tables and S a view, like this:

我们知道, S 表是一张基本表, 而 LS 以及 NLS 是两个视图。现在请注意观察, 我们可以将他们之间的关系交换过来,即: 把 LS 与 NLS作为基本表,而将 S 作为一个视图, SQL代码如下所示:


	CREATE TABLE LS
		(	SNO VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL ,
			SNAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL ,
			STATUS INTEGER NOT NULL ,
			CITY VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL ,
			UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;
	CREATE TABLE NLS
		(	SNO VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL ,
			SNAME VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL ,
			STATUS INTEGER NOT NULL ,
			CITY VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL ,
			UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;
	CREATE VIEW S AS
		(	SELECT SNO , SNAME , STATUS , CITY
			FROM LS
			UNION
			SELECT SNO , SNAME , STATUS , CITY
			FROM NLS ) ;

Note: In order to guarantee that this design is formally equivalent to the original one, I should really state, and have the DBMS enforce, certain integrity constraints—including in particular constraints to the effect that every CITY value in LS is London and no CITY value in NLS is—but I want to ignore such details for the moment. I’ll have a lot more to say about such matters in a little while, I promise you.


## 尚未整理

注意:为了保证这个设计正式相当于原来的一个,我真的应该状态,DBMS执行,特别是某些完整性限制包含约束效应,每个城市价值在NLS LS是伦敦,没有城市价值不过是我想暂时忽略这些细节。我将有更多的说一会儿这样的事情,我向你保证。




Anyway, the message of the example is that, in general, which tables are base ones and which ones are views is arbitrary (at least from a formal point of view). In other words, in the case at hand, we could design the database in at least two different ways—ways, that is, that are logically distinct but information equivalent. (By information equivalent here, I mean the two designs represent the same information, implying among other things that for any query on one, there’s a logically equivalent query on the other. Chapter 3 elaborates on this concept.) And The Principle of Interchangeability is a logical consequence of such considerations:



不管怎样,消息的例子是,在一般情况下,哪些表是基础的,哪些观点是任意的(至少从一个正式的角度)。,换句话说,我们可以在至少两个不同的ways-ways设计数据库,也就是说,在逻辑上是不同的,但信息等价。(通过信息等效在这里,我的意思是这两个设计代表相同的信息,这意味着在其他任何查询在一个的事情,有一个逻辑上等价查询。第三章阐述了这一概念。)和互换性原则是一个逻辑的结果这样的考虑:




- Definition: The Principle of Interchangeability states that there must be no arbitrary and unnecessary distinctions between base tables and views; in other words, views should—as far as possible—“look and feel” just like base tables so far as users are concerned.

- 定义:可交换性的原则,不能任意的和不必要的基本表和视图之间的区别;换句话说,观点应尽可能——“外观和感觉”就像基表用户而言。




Here are some implications of this principle:

下面是这个原则的一些引申:


- As I’ve already suggested, views are subject to integrity constraints, just like base tables. (We usually think of integrity constraints as applying to base tables specifically, but The Principle of Interchangeability shows this position isn’t really tenable.)
- In particular, views have keys (and so I ought really to have included some key specifications in my view definitions; unfortunately, however, SQL doesn’t permit such specifications).2 They might also have foreign keys, and foreign keys might refer to them.
- Many SQL products, and the SQL standard, provide some kind of “row ID” feature (in the standard, that feature goes by the name of REF types and reference values). If that feature is available for base tables but not for views—which in practice is quite likely—then it clearly violates The Principle of Interchangeability.
- Perhaps most important of all, we must be able to update views—because if not, then that fact in itself would constitute the clearest possible violation of The Principle of Interchangeability.

- 正如我已经说过的,观点是完整性约束,就像基表。(我们通常认为完整性约束申请基表具体来说,但互换性原理显示这个职位不是很站得住脚的。)
- 特别是,观点有钥匙(所以我真的应该包括一些关键规范在我看来定义;不幸的是,然而,SQL不允许这样的规范)。2他们可能也有外键和外键引用它们。
- 许多SQL产品,SQL标准,提供某种形式的“行ID”功能(功能的标准,叫REF类型和引用的值)。如果这功能是用于基表而不是观点实际上是相当likely-then显然违反了可交换性的原则。
- 也许最重要的是,我们必须能够更新一个如果不是,这个事实本身就构成了最可能违反可交换性的原则。

2' Throughout this book I use the term key, unqualified, to mean a candidate key, not necessarily a primary key specifically. In fact, Tutorial D—see Chapter 2—has no syntax for distinguishing between primary and other keys. For reasons of familiarity, however, I use double underlining in figures like Fig. 1.1 to suggest that the attributes so underlined can be thought of as primary key attributes, if you like.

2' 在本书中我使用术语键,不一定合格,意味着一个候选键,一个主键。事实上,教程2 d章没有区分主和其他键的语法。熟悉的原因,然而,我用双下划线数字像图1.1显示的属性,强调可以被认为是主键的属性,如果你喜欢。



### BASE TABLES ONLY: CONSTRAINTS

### 只有基本表才有: 约束

One thing that follows from The Principle of Interchangeability is that the behavior of tables S, LS, and NLS shouldn’t depend on which if any are base tables and which if any are views. Until further notice, therefore, let’s suppose they’re all base tables:

一件事互换性的遵循的原则是年代的行为表,LS,NLS不应该依赖于如果有基表,如果有意见。直至另行通知,因此,让我们假设他们都基本表:


	CREATE TABLE S ( ... , UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;
	CREATE TABLE LS ( ... , UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;
	CREATE TABLE NLS ( ... , UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;

Now, these tables, like all tables, are clearly subject to a number of constraints.

现在,这些表,像所有的表,显然是受到许多限制。


Unfortunately, most of those constraints are quite awkward to formulate in SQL, so I’ll content myself for present purposes with stating them in natural language only (and pretty informal natural language at that, for the most part). Here they are:

不幸的是,大部分的这些约束制定在SQL非常尴尬,所以我会自己给目的陈述内容只在自然语言(和漂亮的非正式的自然语言,在大多数情况下)。他们是:


- {SNO} is a key for each of the tables; also, {SNO} in each of tables LS and NLS is a foreign key, referencing the key {SNO} in table S. Note: For an explanation of why I use braces “{” and “}” here, please refer to SQL and Relational Theory.3
- At any given time, table LS is equal to that restriction of table S where the CITY value is London, and table NLS is equal to that restriction of table S where the CITY value isn’t London. Moreover, every row of table LS has CITY value London,4 and no row of table NLS does.
- At any given time, table S is equal to the union of tables LS and NLS; moreover, that union is disjoint (i.e., the corresponding intersection is empty)—no row in S appears in both LS and NLS. To spell the point out in detail: Every row in S also appears in exactly one of LS and NLS, and every row in either LS or NLS also appears in S.
- Finally, the previous constraint and the constraint that {SNO} is a key for all three tables, taken together, imply that every supplier number (not just every row) in S also appears in exactly one of LS and NLS, and every supplier number in either LS or NLS also appears in S.

- { SNO }是一个关键的每个表;此外,{ SNO }在每个表的LS和NLS是一个外键,引用关键{ SNO }在表注:解释为什么我使用括号“{”和“}”在这里,请参阅SQL和关系Theory.3
- 在任何给定的时间,表LS等于限制表的值是伦敦,和表NLS等于限制表年代城市价值不是伦敦。此外,表的每一行LS伦敦城市价值4和NLS并没有排表。
- 在任何给定的时间,表年代等于表LS和NLS的联盟;此外,联盟是分离(即。,相应的交集为空)-不行年代出现在LS和NLS。详细的指出:每一行的年代也出现在LS和NLS之一,和每一行LS或NLS也出现在年代。
- 最后,先前的约束和约束,{ SNO }是一个关键的三个表,总的来说,意味着每个供应商号码(不是每一行)的年代也出现在LS和NLS之一,和每个供应商数量在LS或NLS也出现在年代。





Of course, as the immediately preceding bullet point illustrates, the foregoing constraints aren’t all independent of one another—some of them are logical consequences of others.

当然,作为前立即重点说明,上述约束并不都是一个独立的另一些是别人的逻辑后果。

3' I remind you from the preface that throughout this book I use “SQL and Relational Theory” as an abbreviated form of reference to my book SQL and Relational Theory: How to Write Accurate SQL Code (2nd edition, O’Reilly, 2012).

3' 我提醒你们,我在本书中使用SQL和关系理论”作为一个缩写形式的引用我的书SQL和关系理论:如何写准确的SQL代码(第二版,O ' reilly,2012)。


4' Precisely because of this fact, a more realistic version of view LS would probably drop the CITY attribute. I choose not to do so here, in order to keep the example simple.

4' 正是因为这个事实,一个更现实的版本来看LS城市属性可能会下降。我选择不这样做在这里,为了保持示例简单。



### BASE TABLES ONLY: COMPENSATORY ACTIONS

### 只有基本表支持: 补偿行为


Now, in order to ensure that the constraints outlined in the previous section continue to hold when certain updates are done, certain compensatory actions need to be in effect. In general, a compensatory action—also known as a compensating action—is an additional update (over and above some update explicitly requested by the user) that’s performed automatically by the DBMS, precisely in order to avoid some integrity violation that might otherwise occur.5 Cascade delete is a typical example.6 In the case at hand, in fact, it should be clear that cascading is exactly what we need to deal with DELETE operations in particular. To be specific, deleting rows from either LS or NLS clearly needs to cascade to cause those same rows to be deleted from S. So we might imagine a couple of compensatory actions—actually cascade delete rules—that look something like this (hypothetical syntax):

现在,为了确保在前一节中列出的限制继续持有当某些更新完成,实际上需要一定的补偿行为。一般来说,补偿行为也称为补偿行动是一个额外的更新(超过一些更新由用户显式地请求)由DBMS自动执行,正是为了避免可能发生的一些违反完整性。5级联删除是一个典型的例子。6中,事实上,它应该清楚,级联正是我们需要处理删除操作。具体而言,从LS或删除行NLS显然需要级联导致这些行被删除从美国所以我们想象的补偿性actions-actually级联删除规则,像这样的(假设的语法):



	ON DELETE d FROM LS : DELETE d FROM S ;
	ON DELETE d FROM NLS : DELETE d FROM S ;

Likewise, deleting rows from S clearly needs to cascade to cause those same rows to be deleted from whichever of LS or NLS they appear in:

同样,从年代显然需要级联删除行导致这些行被删除从哪个LS或NLS他们出现在:


	ON DELETE d FROM S :	DELETE ( d WHERE CITY = ‘London’ ) FROM LS ,
							DELETE ( d WHERE CITY <> ‘London’ ) FROM NLS ;


As an aside, I remark that, given that an attempt to delete a nonexistent row has no effect—or so I’m going to assume, at any rate—we could replace each of the expressions in parentheses in the foregoing rule by just d. However, the expressions in parentheses are perhaps preferable, at least inasmuch as they’re clearly more specific.

说句题外话,我的话,考虑到为了删除一个不存在的行没有效果或所以我要假设,在任何我们可以取代每个表达式的括号在上述规则只有d。然而,括号中的表达式也许更可取,至少因为他们显然更具体。


Analogously, we’ll need some compensatory actions (“cascade insert rules”) for INSERT operations:

类似地,我们需要一些补偿措施(“级联插入规则”)插入操作:


	ON INSERT i INTO LS : INSERT i INTO S ;
	ON INSERT i INTO NLS : INSERT i INTO S ;
	ON INSERT i INTO S :	INSERT ( i WHERE CITY = ‘London’ ) INTO LS ,
							INSERT ( i WHERE CITY <> ‘London’ ) INTO NLS ;

<hr/>

5' One reviewer asked why I chose the term compensatory action for this construct. Well, I should have thought the answer was obvious, but in case it isn’t, let me spell it out: The reason I call such actions “compensatory” is because they cause a second update to be done to compensate for the effects of the first (speaking a trifle loosely, of course).

5' 一位评论家问我为什么选择这个构造的术语补偿行动。好,我本以为答案是显而易见的,但它不是,且听我娓娓道来:我叫这样的行为“补偿”的原因是,因为他们导致第二个更新做弥补的影响第一(当然,说话有点松散)。


6' Cascade delete is usually thought of as applying to foreign key constraints specifically; however, the concept of compensatory actions is actually more general and applies to constraints of many kinds.

6' 级联删除通常被认为是特别申请外键约束;然而,补偿行为实际上是更一般的概念,适用于许多类型的约束。


Note: The concept of cascade insert doesn’t usually arise in connection with foreign key constraints, of course, but that’s no reason not to support such a concept in general. More important, don’t get the idea that compensatory actions must always take the form of simple cascades. While the ones discussed in this introductory chapter do all happen to take that form, more complicated cases are likely to require actions of some less straightforward form, as we’ll see in later chapters. 

注意:级联的概念插入通常不会出现在与外键约束,当然,但没有理由不支持这样一个概念。更重要的是,不要让她认为补偿行为必须采取简单的级联的形式。虽然这篇介绍性章节中讨论的所有形式的发生采取,更复杂的情况下可能需要操作的一些不太直观的形式,正如我们将看到在后面的章节。


As for UPDATE operations, they can be regarded, at least in the case at hand, as a DELETE and an INSERT taken in combination; as a consequence, the necessary compensatory actions are just a combination of the corresponding delete and insert actions, loosely speaking.

至于更新操作,他们可以被认为,至少在手边,删除和插入相结合,因此,必要的补偿行为只是结合相应的删除和插入操作,松散。


For example, consider the following UPDATE on table S:

例如,考虑在表 S 上执行更新:


	UPDATE S
	SET CITY = ‘Oslo’
	WHERE SNO = ‘S1’ ;

What happens here is this:

1. The existing row for supplier S1 is deleted from table S and a new row for that supplier, with CITY value Oslo, is inserted into that same table.
2. The existing row for supplier S1 is deleted from table LS as well, thanks to the cascade delete rule from S to LS, and the new row for that supplier, with CITY value Oslo, is inserted into table NLS as well, thanks to the cascade insert rule from S to NLS. In other words, the row for supplier S1 has “migrated” from table LS to table NLS! (Of course, here I’m speaking very loosely indeed.)


现在情况是这样的:

1. 现有的供应商行S1从表和一个新行删除供应商,与城市价值奥斯陆,插入到相同的表。
2. 从表中删除现有的供应商行S1 LS,由于级联删除规则从年代到LS,和供应商的新行,奥斯陆与城市价值,插入表NLS,由于级联从年代NLS插入规则。换句话说,供应商S1的行“迁移”从表LS表NLS !(当然,这里我说非常松散。)





Suppose now that the original UPDATE had been directed at table LS rather than table S:

	UPDATE LS
	SET CITY = ‘Oslo’
	WHERE SNO = ‘S1’ ;


Now what happens is this:

1. The existing row for supplier S1 is deleted from table LS.
2. An attempt is made to insert a new row for supplier S1, with CITY value Oslo, into table LS. That attempt fails, however, because it violates the constraint on table LS that the CITY value in that table must always be London. So the update fails overall; the previous step (viz., deleting the original row for supplier S1 from LS) is undone, and the net effect is that the database remains unchanged.


现在情况是这样的:

1. 从表中删除现有的供应商行S1 LS。
2. 试图插入一个新行供应商S1,奥斯陆与城市价值,为表LS。尝试失败,然而,因为它违反了约束表LS的城市价值表必须是伦敦。所以整个更新失败,前一步为供应商(即,删除原始行S1从LS)撤销,和净效应是数据库保持不变。




### VIEWS: CONSTRAINTS AND COMPENSATORY ACTIONS

### 视图:约束和补偿的行为


Now I come to the real point of this chapter: Everything I’ve said in the previous two sections applies pretty much unchanged if some or all of the tables concerned are views. For example, suppose as we originally did that S is a base table and LS and NLS are views:

现在我来真正的本章指出:一切我说在前面两个部分几乎不变,如果适用于部分或全部有关表视图。例如,假设我们最初一样,年代是一个基表和LS和NLS视图:


	CREATE TABLE S ( .............. , UNIQUE ( SNO ) ) ;
	CREATE VIEW LS AS ( SELECT ... WHERE CITY = ‘London’ ) ;
	CREATE VIEW NLS AS ( SELECT ... WHERE CITY <> ‘London’ ) ;

Now consider a user who sees only views LS and NLS, but wants to be able to behave as if those views were actually base tables. As far as that user is concerned, then, those tables have semantics as follows:

现在考虑一个LS和NLS用户只能看到视图,但是希望能够像如果那些观点实际上是基表。作为该用户而言,这些表语义如下:


  LS: Supplier SNO is under contract, is named SNAME, has status STATUS, and is located in city CITY (which is London).

  NLS: Supplier SNO is under contract, is named SNAME, has status STATUS, and is located in city CITY (which is not London).


  LS:供应商SNO合同,名叫SNAME,身份地位,位于城市城市(伦敦)。

  NLS:供应商SNO合同,名叫SNAME,身份地位,位于城市城市(非伦敦)。


That same user will also be aware of the following constraints (note that these constraints make no mention of table S, because the user in question doesn’t even know table S exists):

- {SNO} is a key for both LS and NLS.
- Every row in LS has CITY value London, and no row in NLS does.
- No supplier number appears in both LS and NLS.


相同的用户也会意识到下面的约束(注意,这些约束没有提到的表,因为用户问题甚至不知道表中存在):

- {SNO} 是 LS 以及 NLS 的主键(key).
- LS 中每一行的 CITY 值都是 `London`, 而 NLS 则没有CITY值为 `London` 的行.
- 在 LS 和 NLS 中都没有供应商编号.

However, that user won’t be aware of any compensatory actions as such, precisely because he or she isn’t aware that LS and NLS are actually views of S; indeed, as I’ve already said, the user isn’t even aware of the existence of S (which is why that user is also unaware of the constraint to the effect that the union of LS and NLS is equal to S). But updates by that user on LS and NLS will all work as far as that user is concerned exactly as if LS and NLS really were base tables. Also, of course, updates by that user on LS and NLS will have the appropriate effects on S, even though those effects won’t be directly visible to that user.

然而,用户不会意识到任何补偿行为,正是因为他或她不知道LS和NLS实际上是视图的;事实上,我已经说过了,用户甚至不知道存在的年代(这就是为什么,用户也不知道联盟的约束效应,LS和NLS等于年代),但更新LS和NLS用户将所有工作,用户而言就像如果LS和NLS真的是基表。当然,也更新到该用户在LS和NLS将适当的影响,尽管这些影响不会直接对用户可见。




### THERE’S NO MAGIC

### 一切都很平凡

Now consider a user who sees only, say, view LS (i.e., not view NLS and not base table S).

现在考虑一个用户只能看到,视图LS(即。,而不是视图NLS而不是基表。


Presumably this user still wants to be able to behave as if LS were a base table. Of course, this user will certainly know the semantics of that table—LS: Supplier SNO is under contract, is named SNAME, has status STATUS, and is located in city CITY (which is London).

大概这个用户仍然希望能够像如果LS是基表。当然,这个用户肯定会知道,LS表的语义:供应商SNO合同,名叫SNAME,身份地位,位于城市城市(伦敦)。


—and will also be aware of the following constraints:

- {SNO} is a key for LS.
- Every row in LS has CITY value London.

并将注意以下约束:

- {SNO} 是 LS 的主键(key).
- LS 中每一行的 CITY 值都是 `London`.

Clearly, this user can’t be allowed to insert rows into this table—nor to update supplier numbers within this table—because such operations have the potential to violate constraints of which this user is unaware (and must be unaware).7 But if LS really were a base table, it would surely be possible to insert rows into it, wouldn’t it? Indeed, if it weren’t, then the table would always be empty! So doesn’t the foregoing state of affairs constitute a violation of The Principle of Interchangeability?

显然,该用户不能被允许将行插入到该table-nor更新供应商编号在此表,因为这样操作有可能违反约束的这个用户是不知道(必须不知道)。7但如果LS真的是基表,它肯定会有可能将行插入到它,不是吗?事实上,如果不是,那么表将永远是空的!所以没有上述情况构成违反原则的可交换性?



In fact it does not. While it’s true that this particular user can’t be allowed to insert rows into the table, that’s not the same as saying no user is allowed to do so. The basic reason why this particular user can’t insert rows into LS is that this user is seeing only part of the picture, as it were. Contrast a user who does see both LS and NLS, which in combination are information equivalent to the original table S; as we saw in the previous section, such a user certainly can insert rows into LS (and/or NLS). But the user who sees only LS is seeing something that isn’t information equivalent to the original table S, and so it’s only to be expected that there’ll be certain operations that he or she can’t be allowed to do.

事实上并非如此。虽然确实这个特定的用户不能被允许将行插入到表中,这并不是说不一样的用户被允许这样做。这个特定的用户的基本原因不能插入行LS是该用户只能看到图片的一部分,。对比LS和NLS用户谁看到,相当于原始表相结合的信息年代,正如我们在前一节中看到的,这样的用户肯定可以将行插入LS(和/或NLS)。但是用户只能看到LS是谁看到的东西并不等同于原始表的信息年代,所以这只是预计会有特定的操作,他或她不被允许做的事情。



In closing, it’s worth pointing out that even here there are parallels with the situation in which all tables involved really are base tables. That is, even when the tables in question are all base tables, it’ll sometimes be the case that certain users will be prohibited from performing certain updates on certain tables. By way of example, consider a user who sees only base table SP and not base table S. Like the user who sees only table LS, that user can’t be allowed to perform insert operations, because such operations have the potential to violate constraints of which that user is unaware (and must be unaware)—to be specific, the foreign key constraints from SP to tables S and P.

最后,值得指出的是,即使在这里也有相似之处涉及所有表的情况真的是基表。,即使有问题的表都是基表,它有时会是这样,某些用户将禁止执行特定的某些表上更新。举个例子,考虑一个用户只能看到基表SP和基表S不像LS的用户只能看到表,该用户不能被允许执行插入操作,因为这样操作有可能违反约束的用户并不知道(和必须知道)——具体而言,SP表的外键约束S和P。




7' I suppose the user might be allowed to perform such operations if he or she is also prepared to accept occasional error messages to the effect that an operation is rejected simply “because the system says so,” without further explanation. See Chapter 4 for further discussion of this point.

7' 我想可能允许用户执行这样的操作,如果他或她也准备接受偶尔的错误消息,大意是说一个操作被拒绝简单的“因为系统如此说,“没有进一步解释。见第四章进一步讨论这一点。



### CONCLUDING REMARKS

### 结束语

This brings me to the end of the discussion of the motivating example. Now, that example is extremely simple, and the conclusions I’ve drawn from it are perhaps all very obvious; but what I’m suggesting is that thinking of views as base tables “living alongside” the tables in terms of which they’re defined is a fruitful way to think about the view updating problem in general—indeed, not just a fruitful way, but a way I believe is logically correct.8 The overall idea is thus as follows:

这给我带来了激励的例子的讨论的结束。现在,示例非常简单,结论我从它也许是非常明显的;但我建议的是,思维视图的基表“一起生活”的表,他们的定义是一种卓有成效的方式思考general-indeed视图更新的问题,不仅仅是一个卓有成效的方式,但是我相信在逻辑上是正确的。8因此总的想法是如下:


1. The view defining expressions imply certain constraints. For example, the view defining expression for view LS (“London suppliers”) implies a constraint to the effect that LS is equal to that restriction of table S where the CITY value is London.
2. Such constraints in turn imply certain compensatory actions (i.e., actions that need to be performed, over and above updates that are explicitly requested by the user, in order to avoid some integrity violation that might otherwise occur). For example, the constraints on tables S, LS, and NLS imply certain cascade deletes and cascade inserts, as we’ve seen.


1. 视图定义表达式意味着某些约束。例如,视图定义的表达式视图LS(“伦敦供应商”)意味着一个约束,LS等于限制表年代伦敦城市价值在哪里。
2. 这种约束反过来意味着某些补偿行为(即。需要执行的行动,超过由用户显式地请求更新,为了避免一些完整性违反可能发生的)。例如,限制表年代,LS,和NLS暗示特定的级联删除和级联插入,正如我们所看到的。



By the way, I’d really like to stress this latter point—the point, that is, that it should be possible for the compensatory actions that apply in a given situation to be determined by the DBMS from the pertinent view defining expression. In other words, what I’m not suggesting is that such actions need to be specified explicitly, thereby imposing yet another administrative burden on the already overworked DBA.9 But this issue, like many others I’ve touched on briefly in this introductory chapter, will be explored in more detail in later parts of the book.

顺便说一下,我真的想强调后者这样的观点,也就是说,它应该有可能的补偿行为在特定情况下适用于由DBMS从相关的视图定义表达式。换句话说,我不是建议的是,这样的行为需要显式地指定,从而实施另一个已经劳累DBA的行政负担。9但这个问题,像许多其他我短暂的接触到了在这个介绍性章节,将在后面的部分中更详细地探讨书。


In closing, let me suggest that if (like most people) you skipped the preface and started straight in on this first chapter, now would be a good time to go back and read the preface, before you move on to the next chapter. Among other things, the preface includes an outline of the structure of the book overall. It also spells out certain important technical assumptions that I’ll be relying on in the chapters to come, and hence that you need to be aware of.

最后,我建议,如果像大多数人一样你跳过了序言,开始直接在第一章,现在是一个很好的时间回去读序言,再继续下一章。序言,包括一个这本书的结构整体的轮廓。它还阐述了某些重要的技术假设我将依靠在接下来的章节,,因此,你需要注意的。
